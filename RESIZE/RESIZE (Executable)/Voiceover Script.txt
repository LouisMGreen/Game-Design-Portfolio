[Player Spawns In First Room]

(fades in) ... test number 202,756, commence testing with: subject 123A... Welcome to Generix Labs. You are about to undergo a series of tests using the resizer. A new 
addition to our growing arsenal of unique weaponry. Collect the disk you see before you and insert it into your device.

Congratulations, cognitive response seems to be in order. Immediately performing higher than half of the other subjects. 
Most don't even make it from the cells to the test chambers... anyway ... discover a way to get over the wall.

Congratulations. Positive reinforcement is a vital component to motivating those with weaker minds ... so here ... have a banana.
Now ... attempt to leave this room using the resizer's growing ability.

Congratulations, passing the first room means you are within the top 10th percentile of test subjects. Well Done. No banana this time,
verbal praise should be enough of a reward. Insert the new floppy disk into the resizer. This will the user to shrink or
grow themselves.

Do not worry, the resizer will not allow you to grow if the room is not of an appropriate size. 
We added this safety feature after sadly losing a couple of other subjects. A moment of silence please..

That button is rather high, I wonder how you could possibly reach such a platform of that height. Wink Wink Nudge Nudge

You are performing marvelously. This room used to house a previous articial intelegence and robotics project. The left over dummies make for perfect target practise.

Switch the resizer to object mode and attempt to shrink the dummies. It may take multiple hits.

Fear not. I can assure you that this batch of dummies have not yet gained any form of sentiance or learned how to experience human emotion. I am certain
